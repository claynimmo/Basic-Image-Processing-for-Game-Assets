# Basic-Image-Processing-for-Game-Assets
Tool made to convert images into textures usable in games

The program is only built to support png images, and works with the raw byte data from windows System.Drawing and System.Drawing.Imaging libraries.
Because of the libraries, the program can only run on windows.
